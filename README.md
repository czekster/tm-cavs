**Abstract:** "This book offers a gentle introduction to Threat Modelling (TM) Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV).

The manuscript offers an overview of techniques, approaches, and examples of TM in CAVs, outlining vulnerabilities, modelling decisions, standardisation, and compliance."

# Contributions
One remarkable thing that the book unveils is the relationship between standards namely ISO 31000:2018 and ISO/SAE 21434:2021: in blue, there is some ISO 31000:2018 definitions, showcasing that they share a lot of principles altogether.
